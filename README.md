# Aritist_Popularity_Classifier

This is a classifier built to categorize an artist as "hot or not" in terms of popularity based on a couple of select features.  

Where did the data come from? 
 The data was provided by https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/. As you can probably tell, the original dataset is 1 million entries lon. I decided to run this analysis on a subset of that data (10,000 rows) instead, but the same process could be used to extract perhaps a more robust classifier with the full dataset.
 
What do these variables represent? 
Here is a simple field list to describe the variables in this dataset.
